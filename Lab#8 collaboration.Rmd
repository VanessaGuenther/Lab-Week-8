```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
salmon<- read_csv("salmon.csv")
library(car)
library(plotly)
```

4. Exploratory Scatterplot

```{r}
scatter<- ggplot(salmon, aes(x =Year, y =Imports)) +
  geom_point()

scatter

# A linear regression makes sense for this data because imports v.s. year seems to be linearly related.
```

5. Linear Regression in R 

```{r}
#Linear regression for imports v.s year
salmon_model<- lm(Year~Imports, data = salmon)

salmon_model
```

imports(tons)= 0.000199 + 0.0000125(Year)
  - This means that every year 0.0000125 more tons of slamon are exported and that in year 0 0.000199 tons of salmon were exported.
  
6. Model Diagnostics

```{r}
plot(salmon_model)

#residuals appear normally distrubuted and there seems to be no concern over heteroscedacticity or outliers

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(salmon_model)
```

7. Explore Model fit ans significance

```{r}
summary(salmon_model)

# The model signicicantly perdicts the salmon inports p-value = 0 (significantly =0)
# The R^2^ equal to 0.95 which indicates that 95% of salmon imports are determined by year
# 5% of salmon inports are not determined by year

```
